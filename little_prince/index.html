    <h2>TO LEON WERTH</h2>
   <p> <u>I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for dedicating it to a grown-up. I have a serious reason: he is the best friend I have in the world.</u> <span class="reason">I have another reason:</span> this grown-up understands everything, even books about children. I have a third reason: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs cheering up. If all these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this grown-up grew.

   <p>In the book it <b>"Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion."</b> 
    I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle.And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. <span id="one">My Drawing Number One</span>. It looked something like this:</p>
    <img src="img/2.jpg" alt="BOA">
    <p>I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them.

        But they answered:<s>"Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"</s> 
        
        <u> <span class="picture">My drawing was not a picture of a hat</span>. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant.</u> But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of a boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this:</p>
